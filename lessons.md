In this lesson I learned how to fork repositories from github, how to 
push changes from my local repository to the remote repository, and how 
to troubleshootmy own mistakes. I hope I did it all correctly, there are 
still a few things I believe I messed up, like pushing my changes to the 
correct remote repository.
